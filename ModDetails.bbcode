Cora has finally convinced you to give her all the books she can read in exchange for gifts.

[size=3][b]Planned Features[/b][/size][size=4] [/size]
[list]
[*]With the new tracking variables give special rewards to the player as 100, 1000, and 5000 books turned in.
[*]More text random responses for your books using ChatGPT.
[*]More books she will take from Books Revamped and/or other sources.
[*]Make Starborn Cora a companion with this functionality for variant universes.
[/list]
Special note this requires Books Revamp mod for the new books.

[size=4][b][u]Usage[/u][/b][/size]

You have to know Sam and Cora and have Sam set as active Crew or Companion. By know them you have to have asked at least one of their personal questions for some reason (Game engine rule not mine). I only tested the code with Sam set as a companion in a NG+ session there is possible a problem if you don't have access to Sam. Also this mod won't work in almost all of the NG+ variant universes as Cora doesn't exist. There is also a case where Cora leaves to live with her mom and can also be perminantly killed so again this mod will not work. This is the reason for the Staborn Cora mod that is coming soon.
