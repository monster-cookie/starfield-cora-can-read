Special note this requires Books Revamp mod for the new books.

[size=4][b][u]Usage[/u][/b][/size]

You have to know Sam and Cora and have Sam set as active Crew or Companion. By know them you have to have asked at least one of their personal questions for some reason (Game engine rule not mine).

The initial quest "Cora Wants Books" until creation kit arrives can only be triggered automatically via waiting for her and Sam to play a specific skit at the end you will get a prompt to talk to Cora. Unfortunately, without voice acting files the skit plays with no visual clue so you have no idea to stay by them and we can't make voice acting files currently. 

So as an optional route there is a common drop book (until CK arrives then it will be rare) that will trigger the quest when read. The book's name is "Hitchhiker's Guide to Unity and the Multiverse" you can either wait and find as drop, buy it from a book vendor, or use the console command below to add it to your inventory. No matter how you acquire it once you read it, the initial quest will trigger, and you will get a marker directing you to Cora. 

Console command is "player.additem ##00084F 1" without the quotes and replace ## with the mod index for Books Revamp as the book comes from that mod now. 

I only tested the code with Sam set as a companion in a NGP session there is possible a problem if you don't have access to Sam. Also this mod won't work in almost all of the NGP variant images as Cora doesn't exist.
