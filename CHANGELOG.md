# V1.0 Permutations

## V1.0.3
* Split some more of the responses there were supposed to be random in to separate responses in a dialog group
* There is a new random skit that will spawn when cora, you, and Sam are together that will trigger the "Cora want books" quest. This is sort of a sucky way cause without voice acting nothing plays for skits. I'm going to see if I can use one of the other quest tree will work so you have mostly voice acting to tell you what is going on. I'm also going to add a new random drop book that when read will start the quest. 
* "Cora wants/consumes books" quests are now gated behind Sam being and active crew member. 

## V1.0.2
* Using ChatGPT generated lines for the initial quest so they sound more like a young girl said them. 

## V1.0.1
* Cora will now take dracula 
* Dracula and War of the world now have chat gpt created responses
* Have a template for fixing all the random responses playing not just 1 but will take a bit to convert everything over. 
* Restore the deleted script files from the 1.0.0 build which is why Cora has been refusing to talk about books. 

## V1.0.0
* Initial Release
